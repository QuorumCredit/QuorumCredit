// ── Issue #109: Structured ApiError shape ────────────────────────────────────

/// A structured error payload that can be surfaced to off-chain clients.
///
/// When a contract function returns a `ContractError`, integrators can convert
/// it into an `ApiError` for consistent JSON/API response shaping:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   "code": 1,
///   "message": "InsufficientFunds",
///   "details": "Total vouched stake is below the requested loan threshold."
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Fields
/// - `code`    — The stable numeric error code matching `ContractError` discriminants.
/// - `message` — Short, human-readable error name (matches the enum variant name).
/// - `details` — Optional extended description, may contain context-specific hints.
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
